_PLEASE NOTE: That due to certain protection settings on files that unity imposses when you maunually zip a project it can sometimes result in meta files not having the correct permissions and not being able to be read. If you are running into problems with the ziped version of the project please contact the dev team as we can give you access to the git repo to pull and compile as this will not have these issues. (This is a KNOWN issue with zipping up the unity project however this is the method of submission)_

# Code base structure
The full code base can be found under **_/Grimalkin/_**
- However NOTE that due to this being a unity project alot of the files are just config or asset files and will therefore be unreadable
- To find the scripts that were developed to produce the game please go to **_/Grimalkin/Assets/Scripts_**
